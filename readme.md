# Semester Project 2: Auction site

## About my project

### Project planning and management using Trello

I used Trello to plan and manage my project. You can see my Trello-board here: https://trello.com/b/gghTnfyM/semesterprosjekt2-auction-site.

Unfortunately my free version of Trello did not support the timeline-view (calendar-view), but you can still see my dates for each part of the project if you use the link above and view my cards.



### Prototype/Design using Figma

This is my prototype by Figma: https://www.figma.com/file/TLYb9WXWRqMya2lNF5iewE/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=mpomWsJadl06Di48-1

I have tried to keep it simple and just focused on showing my desting on this prototype.

I made this style-guide: https://www.figma.com/file/fURXgCQt40py9EY3hxrZUB/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=OnjkAYneoMzDBRGk-1

### Hosting

My site is hosted by Netlify at this address: https://rfh-sp2auction-final.netlify.app/

### Challenges in the project

Ive had some challenges during the project. That's why I do now deliver the project without a working way to place bids or to show bids made on the items. I have asked for help on discord and got some good help, from @chalund (Charlotte Lund) and @spookyrumble on Discord.

I did not make to finish the project 100% because of the challenges Ive got.


## Setting Up and Running the JavaScript API Project Locally:

### Prerequisites:
#### 1. Node.js and npm: Ensure that Node.js (which includes npm) is installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website: Node.js.

### Steps:
#### 1. Clone the Repository:

- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Use the following command to clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Kobraz/sp2.git
```
- This will create a local copy of the repository on your machine.

#### 2.Navigate to the Project Directory:

- Change your directory to the project folder:
```
cd sp2
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies:

- Use npm to install project dependencies:
```
npm install
```
- This command will install all required packages listed in the package.json file.

#### 4. Start the Project:

- Start the project:
```
npm start
```
- This command will run the project. Usually, it will start a server on a specified port (e.g., http://localhost:3000).

#### 5. Access the API:

- Open a web browser or a tool like Postman.
- Use the specified endpoint (e.g., http://localhost:3000) to interact with the API endpoints as defined in the project.

## Special Instructions for Testers:

#### 1. Testing Scenarios:

- Testers should create various testing scenarios covering different use cases to ensure the API functions correctly under various conditions.

#### 2. Test Data:

- Prepare necessary test data to simulate real-world scenarios.

#### 3. API Documentation:

API documentation can be found here: https://docs.noroff.dev/auctionhouse-endpoints/authentication and here: https://api.noroff.dev/docs/

#### 4. Logging and Reporting:

- Be sure to log any issues, errors, or unexpected behaviors encountered during testing and report them with clear steps to reproduce the problem.

#### 5. Security Testing:

- Perform security testing to ensure that the API is robust against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.

#### 6. Load and Performance Testing:

- Perform load and performance testing to evaluate how the API behaves under different loads and identify potential bottlenecks or performance issues.

#### 7. Compatibility Testing:

- Test the API across different browsers, devices, and operating systems to ensure compatibility.

#### 8. Feedback and Collaboration:

- Provide feedback, suggestions for improvements, or any other observations that can enhance the quality of the API.
